# Traffic Sign Recognition using Web Cam

[![-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/aqua.png)](https://github.com/BaseMax?tab=repositories)


Traffic sign recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing road safety and navigation systems. This project leverages the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques to build a CNN model capable of accurately identifying various traffic signs. By integrating webcam functionality, the model can process real-time video streams, detect traffic signs, and provide relevant information to drivers or autonomous vehicles.
